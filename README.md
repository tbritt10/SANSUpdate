# SANSUpdate
A python script to compile an excel file report based on two reports from seperate databases. Made while working as a student assistant at JSU.

Requirements: openpyxl, SANS.xlsx (SANS database report), and ActiveEE (JSU Employee database report).
In order to do a demo of the script simply create three excel files with the correct names as per the comparexl.py file.
