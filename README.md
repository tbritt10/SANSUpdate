# SANSUpdate
A python script to compile an excel file report based on two reports from seperate databases. Made while working as a student assistant at JSU.

Requirements: python 3, openpyxl, SANS.xlsx (SANS database report), ActiveEE (JSU Employee database report), and Employees.xlsx (template file for updates on SANS).

In order to do a demo of the script:

Must have python version 3 or greater

Download all files and keep them in the same directory

Install openpyxl by running 'pip install openpyxl' in the command prompt or console.

Remove 'fake' from the names of the excel files. (Excel doesn't allow me to have two files of the same name regardless of directory.)

See documentation for openpyxl here: https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html

File names and column letters are declared as global variables to allow for easily changing.
